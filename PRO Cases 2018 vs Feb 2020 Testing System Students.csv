I brought him to the emergency room, the doctor diagnosed him with mouth ulcers. The next day it had spread to his genital area. By this time, I knew it wasn't mouth ulcers. I came to the Isabel Symptom Checker and put in all of his symptoms. One of the possibilities was Steven-Johnson Syndrome. I then search this and realized, he was most likely having an allergic reaction to the Children's Motrin he had taken for two days, and after seeing the images online, I knew that's what he had. I rush him back to the emergency room, and his was admitted this time. By day three, his vision started to get blurry, and his temperature was rising to 102.9 every two hours.... If is wasn't for your website, I know without a doubt the hospital would have alternated between Tylenol and Motrin for the fever. I truly feel this website saved my son's life, and I just wanted to say thank y ou so much.... My son spent eight days in the hospital. He made a full recovery, and his vision went back to normal after about a month.",Patient,,,

Development of a left supraclavicular lymph node approximately 3 months after the onset of back pain. Past history of note was an episode of shingles 4-6 months prior to the onset of back pain, and mononucleosis 6-12 months prior. Physical exam performed shortly after the onset of back pain apparently was negative. Dx of ""urinary tract INFECT"" treated with antibiotic without relief. Back pain waxed and waned, weakness and weight loss continued over the next 5 months at which time he was experiencing severe back pain and had become very weak.  CT scan revealed a left retroperitoneal mass adjacent to the spinal column; LDH was over 10,000. Additional scans showed a single metastatic lesion in the lungs; an excisional biopsy of the left supraclavicular node was consistent with embryonal cell carcinoma.  Matt underwent 3 courses of chemotherapy followed by surgical removal of the residual retroperitoneal mass, the lung nodule, and the left testicle.  The pathology on all of the excised specimens was negative (scar tissue).  Subsequently, serial CT scans showed a possible change in the retroperitoneal excision site that might indicate a recurrence.  Additional surgery was performed at the U of Indiana-all tissue excised was negative (scar tissue). CT scans and other tumor markers have remained stable since (7 years). It appears that instead of this being a primary testicular carcinoma originating in the testicle, it was due to an arrest of the migration of a nest of germ cells during embryogenesis with those cells later undergoing carcinogenic transformation (much like an undescended testicle).",Patient,,,

As the screen shot from the Isabel system below shows, had the health visitor had access to Isabel they may have been prompted to consider the disease or a referral to the appropriate specialist simply by entering red urine for “pink-stained nappies”. “These examples illustrate the point that many improvements can be made that will not require extra funding. Moreover, a more coordinated approach may speed diagnosis, improve patient experience and outcomes, and save resources resulting from duplication of effort and waste. This can be illustrated by a recent case where a baby was seeing a health visitor with pinkstained nappies, a GP with ‘eczema’, a paediatrician with ‘failure to thrive’, an endocrinologist with excessive hair growth and a dentist with tooth discolouration. It was an expert dermatologist who, by diagnosing the rare disorder congenital erythropoietic porphyria as the cause of all the apparently unrelated problems, enabled all this effort to be better focused with a far better use of the time and energy of those treating the case. Better collaborative working should also lead to improvements in awareness of and advocacy for rare diseases; not only in the general population, but also in healthcare professionals and in policy makers.”",Media,,,

Story : The patient had seen multiple practitioners without resolution.  When she visited her OBGYN and told him the story, the clinician decided to pass the case though Isabel.  With the clinical features entered, a rare diagnosis came up that tweaked the attention of the provider. How Isabel helped: Based on the Isabel checklist, the clinician asked more questions and was able to determine that his patient had travelled to a region of the United States, 10 years earlier, where she was most likely exposed to the parasite responsible for a rare disease which lays dormant for 10 years in the liver.  Tests were done and the diagnosis of Strongyloidiasis was made.  This is another good example of broadening a differential and providing a direction for more pointed questions in order to determine the correct diagnosis. ",Physician,,,

Story:    This is a case given to us from a pediatric setting where a 17 year old girl presented with “severe chest pain radiating to back with tearing quality”.  The physician asked us to input just that sentence on one line.  They wanted to see if Isabel would suggest Aortic Aneurysm.  It did, in fact depending on if you include the terms “with tearing quality” Aortic Aneurysm presents either in the 1st or 6th position. How Isabel helped:  Isabel uses natural language processing and has the ability to take into account discrete clinical features. .  In this case the sentence entered was parsed and extracted the clinical features. The physician said that Isabel served “to wake them up to something they most likely would have missed” since Aortic Aneurysm in a 17 year old female is a very low probability”.",Physician,,,

Story: Starting his on call rotation in the NICU the staff physician saw one of the patients, a 2 month old with a diagnosis of ARDS that caused him some concern as he felt this baby presentation was “off”. This baby had a history of multiple intubations and he wondered what else could be doing on.  He placed ARDS and hyperlipidemia into the clinical features are of Isabel. One diagnosis stood out, Hemophagocytic  Lymphohistiocytosis.  Although hematologists felt that Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis was unlikely he ordered a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. The result of this biopsy provided the needed data for this final diagnosis. How Isabel helped:  When Isabel was used to see “what else it could be” when the existing diagnosis and treatment plan were not in line with the expected outcome.    Although specialist felt the diagnosis of Hemophagocytic  Lymphohistiocytosis was not likely,  this diagnosis presented in the checklist (in the top ten) and  prompted  this physician to digging deeper and get to the correct diagnosis.",Physician,,,

How Isabel helped: Given the communication barrier and his difficulty to express himself they decided to run Isabel in order to see “what else could it be”.  Anaphylaxis listednumber one- although the patient looked septic he was in fact in the beginning stages of Anaphylactic Shock.

Story: The initial working diagnosis was Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a serious fast onset neuromuscular disease causing paralysis.  When lab results returned they saw a low potassium level (or hypokalemia) in the patients’ blood work.  How Isabel helped:  When Isabel was used to see “what else it could be”, they entered hypokalemia along with paralysis.  Isabel included Hyperthyroidism as a possible disease, which broadened their differential.  Although there were no clinical signs of hyperthyroidism (an endocrine disorder) on physical exam, they decided to test him for this disease.  Lab results showed a hyperthyroid issue and this patient was actually suffering from a Thyroid Storm. He received the proper treatment and walked out of the hospital 48 hours later.",Physician,,,
